When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when am working on a project from a public computer or when am security conscious of the file, like virus corrupping the files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To make sure that what am adding to remote repository is tested and properly working.
